# On-Adaptive-Reinforcement-Learning-in-High-Frequency-Trading

This research introduces a novel approach that applies an adaptive Reinforcement Learning
Model to High Frequency Trading. We integrate the Double Q-Network (DQN) framework with
the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for the purpose of data encoding. Specifically, we propose an
innovative dynamic sliding window algorithm, which is designed to adapt to the constantly changing
market conditions. This adaptation is facilitated by utilizing Sortino ratio as a key metric to guide
trading decisions. Through comprehensive empirical studies, which take into account turnover and
transaction costs, we show that this adaptive GRU-DQN approach yields computational benefits and
promising trading performances.
